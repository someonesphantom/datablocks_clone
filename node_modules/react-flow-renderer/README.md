## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming and panning, single- and multi selection of graph elements and keyboard shortcuts are supported out of the box
- **Customizable:** Different [node](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/node-types) and [edge types](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/edges/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered and only those in the viewport are displayed
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/hooks/use-react-flow) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and graph [helper functions](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/graph-util-functions)
- **Plugin Components:** [Background](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/background), [MiniMap](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/minimap) and [Controls](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/controls)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest version of React Flow is to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install react-flow-renderer
```

## Quick Start

This is only a very basic usage example of React Flow. To see everything that is possible with the library, please refer to the [website](https://reactflow.dev) for [guides](https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/custom-nodes), [examples](https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/overview) and [API reference](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/react-flow-props).

```jsx
import ReactFlow, { MiniMap, Controls } from 'react-flow-renderer';

function Flow({ nodes, edges, onNodesChange, onEdgesChange, onConnect }) {
  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
    >
      <MiniMap />
      <Controls />
    </ReactFlow>
  );
}
```

Before you start you need to build the project using `npm run build`.  Then install the React Flow dependencies via `npm install` and the ones of the examples `cd example && npm install`.

If you want to contribute or develop custom features the easiest way is to start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

and the example app via:

```sh
cd example && npm start 
```

The example app serves the content of the `example` folder and watches changes inside the `src` folder. The examples are using the source of the `src` folder.

## Testing

Testing is done with cypress. You can find the tests in the [`integration/flow`](/cypress/integration/flow) folder. In order to run the tests do:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Credits

React Flow was initially developed for [datablocks](https://datablocks.pro), a graph-based editor for transforming, analyzing and visualizing data in your browser. Under the hood, React Flow depends on these great libraries:

* [d3-zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) - used for zoom, pan and drag interactions with the graph canvas
* [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag) - used for making the nodes draggable
* [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - internal state management
